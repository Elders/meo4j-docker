# neo4j-docker

This is a simple docker image that packages the [neo4j:3.4.0](https://hub.docker.com/_/neo4j) image with the [neo4j-apoc-procedures](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures) plugin. Configuration changes are included to allow apoc procedures.

This image unrestricts and whitelists __***all***__ apoc procedures!
